## Create Team Membership

```http request
POST https://HOSTNAME/v1/teams/{teamId}/memberships
```

** Invite a new member to join your team. Provide an ID for existing users, or invite unregistered users using an email or phone number. If initiated from a Client SDK, Appwrite will send an email or sms with a link to join the team to the invited user, and an account will be created for them if one doesn&#039;t exist. If initiated from a Server SDK, the new member will be added automatically to the team.

You only need to provide one of a user ID, email, or phone number. Appwrite will prioritize accepting the user ID &gt; email &gt; phone number if you provide more than one of these parameters.

Use the `url` parameter to redirect the user from the invitation email to your app. After the user is redirected, use the [Update Team Membership Status](/docs/client/teams#teamsUpdateMembershipStatus) endpoint to allow the user to accept the invitation to the team. 

Please note that to avoid a [Redirect Attack](https://github.com/OWASP/CheatSheetSeries/blob/master/cheatsheets/Unvalidated_Redirects_and_Forwards_Cheat_Sheet.md) Appwrite will accept the only redirect URLs under the domains you have added as a platform on the Appwrite Console.

| url | string | URL to redirect the user back to your app from the invitation email.  Only URLs from hostnames in your project platform list are allowed. This requirement helps to prevent an [open redirect](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Unvalidated_Redirects_and_Forwards_Cheat_Sheet.html) attack against your project API. |  |
